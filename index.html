    Welcome to Money Tree. A game all about growing your profits as large as you can. Buy stocks when
    they're down and sell them to make the most money. Grow your net worth (the sum of your stocks and money)
    and reach $1,000,000 to win. Borrow money from the bank to make even more money but be careful,
    the bank will relentlessly take money to pay back your debt. If you end up with more than $100,000
    of negative equity, you will be declared bankrupt.
